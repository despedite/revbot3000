# revbot3000

A dumb bot made for my friend's server. (DEPRECATED)

## How to Run

_Node.JS, NPM and Discord.JS are required._

In a nutshell, after installing dependencies, go to the destination folder and shift + right click on Bot.js. Open in Console (or Powershell) and execute the command via "node bot.js".
